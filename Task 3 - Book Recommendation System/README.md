# Task 3 – Book Recommendation System 📚

This project is part of my Artificial Intelligence Internship at **CodSoft**. It is a **web-based Book Recommendation System** developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **SQLite**. The system suggests books to users based on genres and authors using a lightweight and interactive interface.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop an interactive book recommendation system that provides personalized book suggestions using a pre-populated database and a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

---

## 🗂️ Project Files

- `app.py` – Main Python file containing the Streamlit app code
- `database.db` – SQLite database with book details
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies required to run the app

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** – Web framework for building interactive UI
- **SQLite** – For storing and querying book data
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation
- **Altair / PyDeck** *(Optional)* – For future data visualization (as seen in `requirements.txt`)

---

## 📊 Features

- 📚 Displays a curated list of books from an internal SQLite database
- 🧠 Filters or recommends books based on author/genre logic
- ⚡ Instant feedback using **Streamlit’s reactive interface**
- 🖱️ Simple UI – just open the app in a browser and get suggestions!

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AGOKULKRISHNA/CODSOFT
cd "CODSOFT/Task 3 - Book Recommendation System"
```

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py
