## Task 1 – Rule-Based Chatbot 🤖

This project was developed as part of my **Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodSoft**. It involves building a simple yet effective chatbot that interacts with users through predefined rules and conditional logic, without relying on advanced NLP libraries or machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a basic chatbot using Python that responds to user queries based on keyword matching and rule-based logic. The goal is to simulate a conversational agent using traditional programming techniques.

---

## 📂 Dataset

This project does not use a dataset. All responses are generated based on predefined rules embedded in the script or stored in a separate file (e.g., JSON).

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **If-Else Logic & Pattern Matching** – For decision-making
- **JSON(Optional)** – For modular response rules
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)** *(Optional)* – For text matching
- **Command-Line Interface** – For running the chatbot in the terminal

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Accept user input from the terminal.
2. Match the input against a set of predefined patterns or keywords.
3. Return the appropriate response.
4. Continue interaction until the user exits the conversation.

---

## 💻 Features

- Handles basic greetings, FAQs, and fallback responses.
- Modular design for easy rule expansion.
- Option to store rules externally in a `.json` file.
- User-friendly and runs directly in terminal/console.

## 📈 Sample Interaction

text
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I assist you today?

User: What is Artificial Intelligence?
Bot: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

User: Bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a nice day.
