# Task 2 – Tic Tac Toe AI 🎮🧠

This project is a part of my Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodSoft. In this task, I developed a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game where the computer opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play optimally. The game runs in the terminal and allows a human user to play against an intelligent AI.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To implement the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an unbeatable AI using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI makes decisions based on the optimal move for every possible game state, ensuring maximum challenge for the human player.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `tictactoe.py` – Main game script with AI logic and user interface.
- `minimax.py` *(if used separately)* – Contains the Minimax algorithm logic.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Terminal/CLI** – For interactive gameplay
- **Minimax Algorithm** – To power the AI logic

---

## 🔄 Game Flow

1. The game starts in the terminal with a 3×3 board.
2. The user and the AI take alternate turns.
3. The AI uses Minimax to evaluate all possible future moves.
4. The game ends when there's a winner or the board is full.

---

## 💡 Features

- Turn-based gameplay between user and AI.
- Minimax ensures the AI plays optimally (cannot be defeated).
- Board is redrawn after every move.
- Includes input validation and game-over detection.

## 🎮 Sample Gameplay

```text
You are X | AI is O

 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9

Your move (1-9): 5

 X |   |  
-----------
   | O |  
-----------
   |   |  

Your move (1-9): 1

 X |   |

   | O |  
-----------
   |   | O

...
Winner: AI (O)

```
